# This Linux bash script that was designed for a hosting server that had problem with MySQL using high swap and sites stopped working as a result.
# restarting MySQL helped to solved this. So this script checks if hosted site is loading OK (if MySQL works) and if not, it restart MySQL and report some performance related details to admin via e-mail.
# Script also deletes certain user files in servers /tmp directory (reduce issues caused by injected bad scripts on less protected hosting server)

scriptname=mysqlswapmon
maill=admin@mail
# site located on same server to check to discover whether server is ok (shows no error during mysql swap high usage)
site=domain.name
# define phrasse that is found on above mentioned site in case site is loading properly
